## üì¶ Installation Methods

### Option 1: Desktop Extension (DXT) - Recommended

**Single-click installation** for compatible AI desktop applications:

1. **Download the latest DXT release:**
   - [üì¶ Download latest DXT](https://github.com/mcolyer/mcp-apple-notes/releases/latest) 
   - Look for the `apple-notes.dxt` file in the release assets

2. **Install through your AI desktop application's extension manager**
3. **The extension will be automatically configured and ready to use**

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ One-click installation
- ‚úÖ Enhanced security and validation
- ‚úÖ Automatic dependency management
- ‚úÖ Production-ready configuration
- ‚úÖ Structured logging and monitoring

### Option 2: Traditional MCP Server

**Manual configuration** for custom setups:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mcolyer/mcp-apple-notes.git
   cd mcp-apple-notes
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm exec tsc
   ```

4. Configure Claude Desktop by updating your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "apple-notes": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["build/index.js"],
         "cwd": "/path/to/mcp-apple-notes"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   > **Note:** Replace `/path/to/mcp-apple-notes` with the actual path to your cloned repository.

### First-Time Setup

You may need to authorize the extension to access Apple Notes when first running commands. macOS will prompt you to grant permission for AppleScript automation.

## ‚ö° Tips for Best Results

- Ensure your Apple Notes app is properly configured with iCloud
- Use descriptive titles for better searchability
- Include relevant tags when creating notes for better organization

## üîß Development

### Architecture Overview

The project uses TypeScript with modern ES modules and supports dual distribution:

- **Traditional MCP Server**: Built JavaScript files in `build/` directory
- **Desktop Extension (DXT)**: Self-contained package in `server/` directory with enhanced security

### Key Components

- `src/index.ts`: Main MCP server implementation with tool registration
- `src/services/appleNotesManager.ts`: Apple Notes operations via AppleScript
- `src/utils/applescript.ts`: Secure AppleScript execution with timeout handling
- `src/types.ts`: TypeScript interfaces and type definitions

### Development Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mcolyer/mcp-apple-notes.git
   cd mcp-apple-notes
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Build TypeScript:**
   ```bash
   pnpm exec tsc
   ```

3. **Test the server:**
   ```bash
   node build/index.js
   ```

### Testing

This project includes comprehensive tests to ensure reliability and maintainability:

#### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests once (CI mode)
pnpm run test:run

# Run tests with coverage report
pnpm run test:coverage

# Run only unit tests
pnpm run test:unit

# Run only integration tests
pnpm run test:integration

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
pnpm run test:watch
```

#### Test Structure

- **Unit Tests** (`tests/unit/`): Test individual components in isolation
  - AppleScript utility functions (`tests/unit/utils/applescript.test.ts`)
  - Apple Notes manager class (`tests/unit/services/appleNotesManager.test.ts`)

- **Integration Tests** (`tests/integration/`): Test complete workflows
  - MCP tool handlers (`tests/integration/mcp-tools.test.ts`)

- **Test Helpers** (`tests/helpers/`): Shared utilities for testing
  - Mock creation and validation helpers
  - Date mocking utilities
  - Test response validators

#### Coverage Requirements

- **Lines**: 85% minimum
- **Functions**: 90% minimum  
- **Branches**: 80% minimum
- **Statements**: 85% minimum

Current coverage typically exceeds these thresholds with 100% line coverage on core business logic.

#### Testing Environment

Tests are designed to work in both macOS and CI environments:

- **macOS**: Full integration testing with actual AppleScript mocking
- **CI/Linux**: Unit tests run with comprehensive mocking of macOS-specific features
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated testing on multiple Node.js versions (18, 20, 22)

The test suite uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) for fast, modern testing with TypeScript support.

### Building Desktop Extension (DXT)

The DXT branch contains production-ready enhancements with security validation, structured logging, and bundled dependencies.

1. **Switch to DXT branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dxt-extension
   ```

2. **Build the extension:**
   ```bash
   # Build TypeScript source
   pnpm exec tsc
   
   # Create server directory with bundled dependencies
   mkdir -p server
   cp -r build/* server/
   cp -r node_modules server/
   ```

3. **Automated build script:**
   ```bash
   pnpm exec tsc:dxt
   ```

4. **Package as DXT (requires dxt CLI tool):**
   ```bash
   dxt pack .
   ```

### Key Development Files

- `manifest.json`: DXT extension manifest following v0.1 specification
- `server/`: Complete DXT package with bundled dependencies
- `build-dxt.js`: Automated build script for creating DXT packages
- `DXT_README.md`: Production deployment documentation
- `CLAUDE.md`: Development guide for Claude Code instances

### Security Considerations

- All AppleScript inputs are sanitized to prevent injection attacks
- Quote characters are escaped for safe script execution
- DXT version includes input length limits and timeout management
- Comprehensive error handling prevents system exposure

### Testing

- Manual testing requires Apple Notes app access on macOS
- Server validation through manifest parsing and dependency loading
- No automated test suite currently implemented
